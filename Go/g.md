go 用一个结构`g`来表示一个goroutine
```go
type g struct {
	// Stack parameters.
	// stack describes the actual stack memory: [stack.lo, stack.hi).
	// stackguard0 is the stack pointer compared in the Go stack growth prologue.
	// It is stack.lo+StackGuard normally, but can be StackPreempt to trigger a preemption.
	// stackguard1 is the stack pointer compared in the C stack growth prologue.
	// It is stack.lo+StackGuard on g0 and gsignal stacks.
	// It is ~0 on other goroutine stacks, to trigger a call to morestackc (and crash).
	stack       stack   // offset known to runtime/cgo
	stackguard0 uintptr // offset known to liblink
	stackguard1 uintptr // offset known to liblink

	_panic    *_panic // innermost panic - offset known to liblink
	_defer    *_defer // innermost defer
	m         *m      // current m; offset known to arm liblink
	sched     gobuf
	syscallsp uintptr // if status==Gsyscall, syscallsp = sched.sp to use during gc
	syscallpc uintptr // if status==Gsyscall, syscallpc = sched.pc to use during gc
	stktopsp  uintptr // expected sp at top of stack, to check in traceback
	// param is a generic pointer parameter field used to pass
	// values in particular contexts where other storage for the
	// parameter would be difficult to find. It is currently used
	// in three ways:
	// 1. When a channel operation wakes up a blocked goroutine, it sets param to
	//    point to the sudog of the completed blocking operation.
	// 2. By gcAssistAlloc1 to signal back to its caller that the goroutine completed
	//    the GC cycle. It is unsafe to do so in any other way, because the goroutine's
	//    stack may have moved in the meantime.
	// 3. By debugCallWrap to pass parameters to a new goroutine because allocating a
	//    closure in the runtime is forbidden.
	param        unsafe.Pointer
	atomicstatus uint32
	stackLock    uint32 // sigprof/scang lock; TODO: fold in to atomicstatus
	goid         int64
	schedlink    guintptr
	waitsince    int64      // approx time when the g become blocked
	waitreason   waitReason // if status==Gwaiting

	preempt       bool // preemption signal, duplicates stackguard0 = stackpreempt
	preemptStop   bool // transition to _Gpreempted on preemption; otherwise, just deschedule
	preemptShrink bool // shrink stack at synchronous safe point

	// asyncSafePoint is set if g is stopped at an asynchronous
	// safe point. This means there are frames on the stack
	// without precise pointer information.
	asyncSafePoint bool

	paniconfault bool // panic (instead of crash) on unexpected fault address
	gcscandone   bool // g has scanned stack; protected by _Gscan bit in status
	throwsplit   bool // must not split stack
	// activeStackChans indicates that there are unlocked channels
	// pointing into this goroutine's stack. If true, stack
	// copying needs to acquire channel locks to protect these
	// areas of the stack.
	activeStackChans bool
	// parkingOnChan indicates that the goroutine is about to
	// park on a chansend or chanrecv. Used to signal an unsafe point
	// for stack shrinking. It's a boolean value, but is updated atomically.
	parkingOnChan uint8

	raceignore     int8     // ignore race detection events
	sysblocktraced bool     // StartTrace has emitted EvGoInSyscall about this goroutine

	// Per-G GC state

	// gcAssistBytes is this G's GC assist credit in terms of
	// bytes allocated. If this is positive, then the G has credit
	// to allocate gcAssistBytes bytes without assisting. If this
	// is negative, then the G must correct this by performing
	// scan work. We track this in bytes to make it fast to update
	// and check for debt in the malloc hot path. The assist ratio
	// determines how this corresponds to scan work debt.
	gcAssistBytes int64
